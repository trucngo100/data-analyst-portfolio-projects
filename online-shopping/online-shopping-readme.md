## Insights from Visualization
#### *VIEW 1* - Overview of User Activities during the last 12 months

##### VIEW 1 INSIGHTS
The dashboard starts with a snapshot of the ecommerce website current performance, measuring  how frequently it was visited. 
- Most of our visitors are returning visitors, which means that our customer retention strategy is working well while our acquisition activities are not effective in bringing new customers. Further inspections on the $ value generated by these returning customers must be made, because a high number of customers does not necessarily mean a high number of transactions and high profits.

#### *VIEW 2* - Inspecting how behavior of converters and non-converters are different

It then compares two key visitor groups, converters and non-converters, and highlights how their behavior differs. This includes the average page value ($) of each visitor segment and raises questions about what caused the difference. Sales and Marketing team could brainstorm on how to use A/B testing and tweak their marketing activities to narrow the gap in page value between converters and non-converters.
- The behavior is consistent across all months, with converters generating twice to fourth times as high page value as non-converters.
- Surprisingly, there is not much difference between weekends and weekdays.
- People made more purchases, making the average page value go up as it gets closer to the special days. This means that people are willing to pay more for special occasions. Sales Manager can encourage purchases 7 days before the special days by dropping discounts and bargains. The closer it gets to special days, removing those discounts and selling products at whole price.
- Converters and non-converters are brought to our ecommerce site through different routes. Developers could check whether there are bugs on the route that are used by non-converters.


#### *VIEW 3* - Finding root causes for the behavior discrepancy between converters and non-converters

 Finally, I used Tableau (**Dashboard 3: Behavior Discrepancy Deep Dive**) to find explanations for the difference.
1. Hypothesis 1: The converters generated a higher page value because they browsed more pages
2. Hypothesis 2: The converters generated a higher page value because they spent more time browsing.



# :toolbox: DATA PROCESSING
## Tech Stack
- [Python (pandas and numpy for data cleaning)](https://github.com/trucngo100/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/main/online-shopping/eda.py)
- [Tableau (Visualization)](https://public.tableau.com/shared/M5KY85CMM?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## 1. Data Source Introduction

### 1a. Data Source Link
- [UCI Machine Learning - Online Shopper Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset)

- Brainstorming on how to extract insights from those columns using [Go to Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zpjNvjTLtcC3emXAEUWOm4ZR4A6j3ZK-JcDXgftGgQ/edit?gid=2130198374#gid=2130198374)

## 2. Python - Data Cleaning
 - Files used for cleaning 
	 - [eda.py](https://github.com/trucngo100/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/main/online-shopping/eda.py)

## Technical Challenges
- Lack of session ID: generates unique session ID by using hashlib
- Improper format to work with Tableau: the page count and page duration for each page type is measured and recorded in columns. In order to make dashboard in Tableau, the columns must be combined to form one categorical variable and two contious variables.

## 2. Python - Data Cleaning
 - Files used for cleaning 
	 - [eda.py](https://github.com/aliciango/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/d2fa679ef0a0d917d1ef82b757c2009d79210d3d/unicorn-companies/eda.py)
	 - [eda_23.py](https://github.com/aliciango/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/d2fa679ef0a0d917d1ef82b757c2009d79210d3d/unicorn-companies/eda_23.py)
	 - [eda_24.py](https://github.com/aliciango/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/d2fa679ef0a0d917d1ef82b757c2009d79210d3d/unicorn-companies/eda_24.py)
## 3. Snowflake (SQL) - Database Design and Preparing Data for Visualization
[Snowflake Star & Query Testing](https://app.snowflake.com/axnfple/uhb18311/w31UKE6fN8gN#query)
[Snowflake One Big Table](https://app.snowflake.com/axnfple/uhb18311/w413ag1rvuKi#query)

Now that we already have three cleaned datasets, it is time to combine them. Actually cleaning is an iterative process, so I discovered a few more data quality-related issues while executing queries in snowflake. Therefore, I created the file 
joining_prep.py to do any additional cleaning task. I also used excel to record the current columns that I have in each csv file and document how I am going to use the columns for joining these separate tables from 2022, 2023 and 2024.

| Column Name | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|-------------|------|------|------|
| COMPANY_CLEANED | O | O | O |
| SELECT_INVESTORS | O | O | O |
| VALUATION | O | O | O |
| COUNTRY | O | O | O |
| FUNDING | O | X | O |
| CITY | O | O | X |
| YEARS_TO_UNICORN | O | O | X |
| DATE_JOINED | O | O | X |
| INDUSTRY | O | O | X |
| FUNDING_CURRENCY | O | X | X |
| YEAR_FOUNDED | O | X | X |
| IMG_SRC | X | X | O |
| COMPANY_LINK | X | X | O |
| VALUATION_CURRENCY | X | X | O |

As the data is just crawled from the internet, it is really messy. For the sake of updating and adding the data in the future, I also came up with a star-structure to organize these columns into different views using Snowflake. I have come up with 4 views: INVESTORS, COMPANIES, TIMES_TO_UNICORN, STATUS_CHANGES

![Schema](https://github.com/aliciango/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/fcb5087ebe4dd2112108b45e5b47794e9a86ef64/assets/star%20schema.png)

By organizing data this way, it would be so much easier to query about a specific investor, company,  etc. I have included some queries that I have used to test the if the schema is working properly.

```sql
-- ==============================================================
-- QUERY TESTING
-- Comparing the growth of emerging markets: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa
-- with that of established markets
-- ==============================================================
WITH markets AS (
    SELECT 
        company_cleaned as company, 
        CASE 
            WHEN country IN ('Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China', 'South Africa') 
            THEN 'emerging market' 
            ELSE 'established market' 
        END AS market_cat
    FROM view_companies
) 
SELECT  
    m.market_cat,
    -- average percentage change per industry
    ROUND(AVG(cf.pct_22_23), 2) AS avg_industry_pct_22_23,
    ROUND(AVG(cf.pct_23_24), 2) AS avg_industry_pct_23_24
FROM markets m
INNER JOIN view_companies_full cf 
    ON m.company = cf.company
GROUP BY m.market_cat
ORDER BY avg_industry_pct_22_23 DESC;
```

```sql
-- ==========================
-- the total valuation of companies that have data in all three years
-- TOTAL PORTFOLIO VALUATION 
-- ==============================================================
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW total_portfol_vals AS (
    WITH valid_comp_investors AS (
        SELECT 
            c22.select_investors AS investor
            , c22.company_cleaned AS company
        FROM companies_ls_22 c22
            INNER JOIN companies_ls_23 c23 ON c22.company_cleaned = c23.company_cleaned AND c22.select_investors = c23.select_investors
            INNER JOIN companies_ls_24 c24 ON c24.company_cleaned = c22.company_cleaned AND c23.select_investors = c24.select_investors)
        
    SELECT 
        v.investor
        , SUM(cf.val_2022) total_portfol_val_22
        , SUM(cf.val_2023) total_portfol_val_23
        , SUM(cf.val_2024) total_portfol_val_24
    FROM valid_comp_investors v
    INNER JOIN view_companies_full cf 
        ON v.company = cf.company
    GROUP BY v.investor
    ORDER BY total_portfol_val_22 DESC
);

-- TOTAL PORTFOLIO VALUATION % CHANGE YoY
SELECT 
    *
    , ROUND( (total_portfol_val_23 - total_portfol_val_22)*100::numeric / total_portfol_val_22,2) as pct_portfol_val_22_23
    , ROUND( (total_portfol_val_24 - total_portfol_val_23)*100::numeric / total_portfol_val_23,2) as pct_portfol_val_22_23,
FROM total_portfol_vals;


```
However, designing the project this way cannot allow fast querying, joining for analysis. The goal is to serve the interests of investors by allowing them to view the snapshot of their investment portfolio and picking the company that will increase their value. Therefore, I created an additional view where I aggregated everything and called in 'One Big Table'


## 4. Tableau - Dashboard: Portfolio Management and Deal Sourcing
Using the one big table, I could gain a lot of insights about this dataset. I have included my insights and recommendations in [this link](https://github.com/aliciango/data-analyst-portfolio-projects/blob/d936e06e34322df8660598fec4c685f3698567cf/README.md) for your reference: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/FINISHEDDASHBOARD/DEALSOURCINGDB?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
